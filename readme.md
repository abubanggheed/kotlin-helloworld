# Learning Kotlin
This project is a personal one where I begin working with Kotlin as a third language. It was made on IntelliJ, and is
using that as its runtime environment for now. If you are trying to follow along and are not familiar with IntelliJ apps,
I recommend you use the same resources I did to get started: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started.html.
